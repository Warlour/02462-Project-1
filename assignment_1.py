# # Assignment 1 - CNN's and VGG16
# 
# *In this assingment, you will further familiraize yourself with CNN's and how to implement them. For this particular example, we will ask you to implement the layer structure of VGG16, an old but fairly effective and simple CNN structure.*
# 
# *Keep in mind, that while VGG16 and other CNN's you have implemented so far, only incoporate convolutions and pooling layers, many state-of-the-art models  use a variety of other techniques, such as skip connections (CITATION NEEDED), or self-attention (CITATION NEEDED) to get better results.*
# 
# *As you write code for this assignment, try to keep in mind to write good code. That might sound vague, but just imagine that some other poor sod will have to read your code at some point, and easily readable, understandable code, will go a long way to making their life easier. However, this is not a coding course, so the main focus should of course be on the exercises themselves.*
# 
# **Keep in mind, this assignment does not count towards your final grade in the course. When any of the exercises mention 'grading', it refers to commenting and correcting answers, not necessarily giving you a score which will reflect in your grade, so dw :)**
# 
# 
# **Hand-in date is 8/10 at the latest if you want to recieve feedback!!**

# ## Theoretical questions
# 
# *These questions are meant to test your general knowledge of CNN's, feel free to contact or write the TA's if you have any questions about any of them*
# 
# ### Exercise 1.1
# 
# **1. What is the reason we add MaxPooling or AveragePooling in CNN's?**
# 

# 

# **\*2. Say a network comes with a list of class probabilities:** $\hat{p}_1, \hat{p}_2, \dots \hat{p}_N$ **when is the cross-entropy in regards to the *true* class probabilities:** $p_1, p_2, \dots p_N$ **maximized?**

# 

# **3. In the [VGG paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556), last paragraph of 'training', page 4, they mention images being randomly cropped after being rescaled. Why do you think they crop images only *after* rescaling them?**

# 

# **4. After this, they mention "further augmenting the dataset" by random horizontal flipping and random RGB color shift. Why do you think they do this?**

# 

# **\*5. Why do you think they do not randomly translate images? (Translate being to move images left, right, up, down)**

# 

# **6. Which of the following classification tasks do you think is more difficult for a machine learning model, and why?**
# 
# - **Telling German Shepherds (Sch√¶ferhunde) from Labradors**
# - **Telling dogs from cats**
# - **Telling horses from cars from totem poles from chainsaws**

# 

# **7. In real life, you often find that neural networks aren't used "for everything", older and often more simple models like random forest and linear regression still dominate a lot of fields.**
# 
# - **Reason a bit about why this is the case**

# 

# **\*8. When we sample from our dataloader, we sample in batches, why is this? What would be the alternatives to sampling in batches, and what impact would that have?**

# 

# **9. The VGG16-D conv layers all use the same kernel size. Come up with reasons for why you would use bigger/smaller kernel sizes**

# 

# **\*10. The "new kid on the block' (relatively speaking) in NLP (Natural Language processing), is self-attention. Basically this is letting each word/token relate to each other word/token by a specific 'attention' value, vaguely showing how much they relate to one another.**
# 
# - **Would there be any problems in doing this for image processing by simply letting each pixel relate to each other pixel, so we can get spatial information that way instead?**

# 

# ## Boilerplate end - Your implementation work begins here:
# 
# *Below, you are given a working example of a CNN, not much different from the one in the exercises of week 3. Your job is to complete the implementation questions below. *
# 
# *You do not need to do all the exercises below, or even do them in order, we will obviously only grade the ones you have done, however. Please just mark completed exercises with an X as shown below, so we will know what to look for when grading your assignment. You can add as much text below each question as you want to either argue for your choice of implementation, discuss your results, or ask us questions, we will consider this when grading the assignment.*
# 
# **X 0. This marks a question which has been completed**
# 
# *For your convenience, we reccommend implementing two models: One bigger for the VGG16-D exercises, meant to be used only with images from the Imagenette dataset, and one smaller, which can also take the other datasets. The model already implemented below should fill the role of the latter.*
# 
# *Finally, if you're not able to train the VGG16-D model because it is too big, you can also load the weights of the model using the funciton implemented for exactly that. We do, however, reccommend training it from scratch yourself, if possible.*
# 
# ______________________________________________________________________________________________
# 
# 
# 
# **1. Implement the layer structure of VGG16-D by following either this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@mygreatlearning/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vgg16-7315defb5918) (fairly easy), or the [official paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556) (slightly harder) (Note: This layer structure is meant to be used with 224x224 sized images, only the  imagenette dataset in this notebook has this)**
# 
# ****2. Figure out, and implement the type, and exact settings of the optimizer the original VGG16-D implementation used**  
# - Batch size: $256$
# - Momentum: $0.9$
# - $L_2$ Penalty Multiplier: $5\times 10^{-4}$
# - Dropout ratio: $0.5$
# - Learning rate: $10^{-2}$, but decreased by a factor of 10, everytime the validation set accuracy stopped improving (done 3 times in the report).
# - Epochs: 74
# 
# 
# NOTE: I tried this, and could not, for the life of me learn anything. Attempt this task at your peril
# 
# **3.** 
# - **Can you make the VGG16-D model overfit to the imagenette dataset? If not, what about another dataset?**
#     - Remove dropout layers
#     - Increase amount of epochs
# - **Can you change the amount of dropout to increase or decrease the rate of overfitting?**
#     - Yes, if you increase dropout layers you decrease overfitting, by minimizing the amount of weight that's put on to a single neuron.
# - **Can you make the smaller model overfit to any of its datasets? Is it harder or easier? Explain your answer**
# 
# **4. Try to improve the test accuracy of either of your models by changing some of they hyperparameters. To make it easier, try to keep detailed results of your experimental setups and your preliminary results. Argue for your changes. Examples of possible changes are shown below:**:
# - **Add more/fewer kernels**
# - **Add more/less dropout**
# - **Add [BatchNorm](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html)**
# - **Change the intial transform when loading the data to make larger/smaller images**
# 
# **5. Change the model (or any other code in the whole script) to make either training, inference, or both, as quick as possible, while still keeping a reasonable test accuracy. What did you do to achieve this?**
# 
# **6. During evaluation, extract some images which were not correctly classified, plot these images and reason about what made them hard-to-classify**
